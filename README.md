# Outlook98 style Organizer (notes, tasks, and appointments)

This is one of my earliest experiences with Delphi, but I still find the application useful.

It is written using the Delphi 5 (1999) environment, but it does not depend on internal features of Delphi, so it should be easily upgradable to the latest Delphi. Connection to the latest versions of databases can be made by using ODBC for MS-SQL, Oracle, etc.
